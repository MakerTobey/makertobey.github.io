# Wenzel Lab website

This is a statically-generated Jekyll/Liquid/Bootstrap-based website based on the template created by the [Allan lab](https://www.allanlab.org/) and modified it into a personal academic webpage that met my requirements.
Feel free to reuse it.

### Other Templates

Other Jekyll templates are of course available.
Some of these are viable for very simple academic pages with little tuning:
* [Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)
* [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)
* [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/)
